This plugin only works if 'compatible' is not set.
{Vi does not have any of these features.}

INTRODUCTION                                                     *cocoa-intro*

Cocoa.vim is a collection of scripts designed to make it easier to develop
Cocoa/Objective-C applications. It includes enhanced syntax highlighting, code
completion, documentation lookup, as well as a number of other features that
can be used to integrate Vim with Xcode, allowing you to essentially replace
Xcode's editor with Vim.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION                                              *cocoa-installation*

Documentation lookup and code completion for Cocoa.vim are currently
Leopard-only (although the other parts should work on any platform). To
install, simply unzip cocoa.zip to your home vim directory (typically ~/.vim).

                                                     *cocoa-suggested-plugins*
The code completion in cocoa.vim uses snipMate, if you have it installed, to
allow you to conveniently <tab> over the parameters in functions and
methods. If you like cocoa.vim, you may also find objc_matchbracket.vim
useful.

                                                      *leopard-security-alert*
Documentation works by showing the page in your default browser, which
apparently causes Leopard to warn you of opening an html file for every word
you look up. To fix this, see this page: http://tinyurl.com/remove-annoying-alert

FEATURE OVERVIEW                                              *cocoa-features*

	1. Enhanced syntax highlighting — Vim's syntax highlighting for
	   Objective-C seemed a bit incomplete to me, so I have added a few
	   niceties, such as highlighting Cocoa keywords and differentiating
	   the method name and passed objects in method calls and definitions.
	2. Xcode-like mappings — mappings such as ⌘R to build & run and ⌘0
	   to switch to the project window help to integrate Xcode and Vim. For
	   a complete list of the mappings in cocoa.vim, see |cocoa-mappings|.
	3. Methods for the current file can be listed and navigated to with
	   the |:ListMethods| command.
	4. A template of methods declared in a header file (.h) can be built
	   in an implementation file (.m) with |:BuildMethods|.
	5. Cocoa/C Documentation can be looked up with the |:CocoaDoc| command,
	   or simply with Vim's |K|.
	6. Code completion for classes, methods, functions, constants, types,
	   and notifications can be invoked with <c-x><c-o>. Parameters for
	   methods and functions are automatically converted to snippets to
	   <tab> over if you have snipMate installed.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                     *cocoa-mappings* *g:objc_man_key*

Cocoa.vim maps the following keys, some for convenience and others to
integrate with Xcode:

	|<Leader>|A - Alternate between header (.h) and implementation (.m) file
	K - Look up documentation for word under cursor[1]
	⌘⌥↑ - <Leader>A
	⌘R - Build & Run (Go)
	⌘↩ - ⌘R
	⌘B - Build
	⇧⌘K - Clean
	⌘Y - Build & Debug
	⌘0 - Go to Project
	⌘2 - :ListMethods
	<F5> (in insert mode) - Show omnicompletion menu

	(1. This can be customized by the variable g:objc_man_key.)

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                      *cocoa-commands*

                                                                *:ListMethods*
:ListMethods		Open a split window containing the methods of the
			current file.
                                                               *:BuildMethods*
:BuildMethods [headerfile]
			Build a template of methods in an implementation (.m)
			from a list declared in a header file (.h). If no
			argument is given, the corresponding header file is
			used (e.g. "foo.m" -> "foo.h").
